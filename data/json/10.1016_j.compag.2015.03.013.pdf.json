Particle size fractions affect strongly the physical\nand chemical properties of soil and thus also SOC. Conventional analyses of SOC and particle sizes are\ncostly limiting the detailed characterization of soil spatial variability and fine resolution mapping.\nMobile sensors provide an alternative approach to soil analysis. They offer densely spaced georeferenced\ndata in a cost-effective manner. In this study, two agricultural fields (Voulund1 and Voulund2) in\nDenmark were mapped with the Veris mobile sensor platform (MSP). MSP collected simultaneously visi-\nble near infrared spectra (vis–NIR; 350–2200 nm), electrical conductivity (EC: shallow; 0–30 cm, deep;\n0–90 cm), and temperature measurements. Fuzzy k-means clustering was applied to the obtained spectra\nto partition the fields and to select representative samples for calibration purposes. Calibration samples\nwere analyzed for SOC and particle sizes (clay, silt and sand) using conventional wet chemistry analysis.\nThe objectives of this study were to determine whether it is the single sensors or the fusion of sensor data\nthat provides the best predictive ability of the soil properties in question. Using partial least square\nregression (PLS) excellent calibration results were generated for all soil properties with a ratio of perfor-\nmance to deviation (RPD) values above 2. The best predictive ability for SOC was obtained using a fusion\nof sensor data. The calibration models based on vis–NIR spectra and temperature resulted in\nRMSECV \u003d 0.14% and R2 \u003d 0.94 in Voulund1. In Voulund2, the combination of EC, temperature and spec-\ntral data generated a SOC model with RMSECV \u003d 0.17% and R2 \u003d 0.93. The highest predictive ability for\nclay was obtained using spectral data only in Voulund1 (RMSECV \u003d 0.34% and R2 \u003d 0.76). Whereas in\nVoulund2, improved results were obtained after combining spectral and temperature data\nRMSECV \u003d 0.20% and R2 \u003d 0.92. The best predictions of silt and sand were obtained when using spectral\ndata only and resulted in RMSECV \u003d 0.35%, R2 \u003d 0.82 and RMSECV \u003d 0.85%, R2 \u003d 0.81, respectively, in\nVoulund1 and RMSECV \u003d 0.31%, R2 \u003d 0.86 and RMSECV \u003d 0.74%, R2 \u003d 0.92, respectively, in Voulund2.\nThe best models were used to predict soil properties from the field spectra collected by the MSP.

It has effects on water holding capacity,\nnutrient retention and supply, drainage and nutrient leaching.\nConsequently, reliable techniques for measuring and mapping\nSOC and particle sizes are necessary in precision agriculture for\ndecision-support systems and in sustainable land management\npractices. However, the conventional wet chemistry analyses of\nsoil are costly what limits detailed characterization of spatial vari-\nability of soil and the possibility to create precise and fine res-\nolution soil maps. Thus, alternative approaches are required.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1.2. Visible near infrared spectroscopy and electrical conductivity\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisible Near infrared (vis–NIR) spectroscopy is a rapid and cost-\neffective method which has been used for soil analysis since mid-\n1990s. Vis–NIR spectra carry information on organic and inorganic\nsoil materials, particle size, color and water content. The technique\nemploys measurements of photon energy in the wavelength range\n350-2500 nm. Especially mobile vis–NIRS sensors for soil\ncharacterization are attracting increasing attention due to their\npotential for applications to e.g. precision agriculture or soil map-\nping in general. The first application of on-the-go spectroscopic\nsensors was reported by Shonk et al. (1991) followed by a study\nincluding a prototype portable vis–NIRS sensor developed by\nHummel et al. (1996). Since then, prediction of a range of soil con-\nstituents has been tested using a variety of mobile sensors. The\npredictive abilities of mobile sensors vary significantly and depend\non the type of data fused, soil spatial variability, the concentra-\ntions, and the ranges of the soil attributes (Stenberg and Viscarra\nRossel, 2010). Unlike the well-controlled conditions imposed for\nlaboratory measurements, many less controllable factors can affect\nthe quality of in-situ acquired data such as soil particle size and\naggregation, soil roughness, soil temperature, sensor-to-soil dis-\ntance, vibrations, dust, plant residues, pebbles and stones but also\nconfounding factors such as variation in soil mineralogy, moisture,\norganic matter and their interactions (Morgan et al., 2009; Shonk\net al., 1991).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoil electrical conductivity (EC) is another sensing technique\nand one of the most frequently used measurements for character-\nizing soil variability at field scale for precision agriculture because\nof its reliability, accuracy, high number of measurements and ease\nof collecting the data (Corwin and Lesch, 2003). It can be measured\nusing electromagnetic induction or galvanic contact resistivity\nmethods. EC is a function of the soil physical and chemical proper-\nties, soil salinity, saturation, water content and bulk density\n(Corwin and Lesch, 2003). It has been therefore widely used for\nmapping the variation in soil particle sizes, salinity, water content,\nbulk density, organic matter (OM) and temperature (Broge et al.,\n2004; Corwin and Lesch, 2005; Domsch and Giebel, 2004;\nKochanowski et al., 1988; Lück et al., 2009; Lund et al., 1999;\nMoral et al., 2010; Sudduth et al., 2005). Moreover, it was found\nthat EC increases 1.9% per 1 �C (Corwin and Lesch, 2005). Thus, soil\ntemperature can be correlated to EC and easily used as additional\nvariable in soil mapping.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1.3. Sensor data fusion\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMobile sensors such as vis–NIRS or EC sensors, can generate the\ndensely spaced geo-referenced data in a cost-effective manner\nnecessary for capturing soil spatial variability and are therefore,\npowerful tools for landscape-scale soil characterization (Malley\net al., 2004). However, when using only one sensor it is not possible\nto measure all soil properties. Viscarra Rossel et al. (2011) listed a\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM.

In search of robust calibrations we tested EC,\ntemperature, and vis–NIR spectral data individually, and different\ncombinations of these predictors for each soil property and field\nseparately.

Soil analysis and mapping in Denmark\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe existing information on soil properties in Denmark was\nobtained in the mid 70s during the Danish Soil Classification\n(Madsen et al., 1992). Not only is this information outdated but\nthe data has also insufficient spatial resolution (1:50,000) for man-\nagement on a field scale. Hence, new soil data must be collected\nand reflect the current soil properties on specific field, and at a\nspecific location in this field. Detailed information of such soil\nproperties as SOC and particle sizes can help Danish farmers to\ngain a better insight on the quality of their soil and support deci-\nsion making to achieve higher yields. Moreover it can be used in\nthe environmental regulation of agricultural production and will\nto a great extent help Denmark to fulfill the responsibilities of\nthe Kyoto protocol from 1997.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo supplement the time-consuming and costly conventional\napproach to soil survey in Denmark, a method for SOC and particle\nsizes mapping employing the use of vis–NIR, EC and temperature\nsensors was investigated. Considering the advantages of NIRS and\nEC sensing techniques in combination with a mobile sensor plat-\nform for soil surveying the objective of this study was to test the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edata due to different sensors measuring the same soil, extended\nattributes coverage, and increased dimensionality of the measure-\nment space. Thus, for improved estimation of soil properties a\nfusion of conceptually different mobile sensors has been investi-\ngated in some studies. Knadel et al. (2011) reported on mobile soil\nsensor data fusion using the Veris mobile sensor platform (MSP)\nconsisting of an optical shank-based vis–NIR (visible-near infrared)\nsensor and EC measurements to map soil organic carbon (SOC)\nwithin a partly highly variable field in Denmark.

Soil sampling and laboratory analysis\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA total of 30 sampling locations (15 from each field) were\nselected for calibration purposes. The selection procedure for cali-\nbration samples was done following the protocol described by\nChristy (2008). In short, to determine representative sampling\nlocations from the acquired spectral data, soil spectra were first\ncompressed with a principal component analysis (PCA). Samples\nwith a Mahalanobis distanceP3H (H is the leverage statistic) were\nconsidered as outliers and removed. A fuzzy c-means algorithm\nwas applied to cluster spectral data into 15 spatial clusters sepa-\nrately for each field. Within each cluster a location was chosen so\nthat it was close to the center of the cluster in spectral data space\nand was geographically surrounded by most points from the same\ncluster (Fig. 3). Knadel et al. (2013) investigated the effects of sam-\nple number on the predictive ability of PLS calibration models for a\nhighly heterogeneous field in Denmark. The authors showed that\n15 representative calibration samples for a 14.6 ha field provided\nacceptable results for SOC and texture predictions, reducing signifi-\ncantly the costs of reference sampling and analysis.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two Voulund fields can be characterized as relatively\nhomogenous in terms of soil properties and are of a similar size\nas the one of Knadel et al. (2013). Therefore, an equally low num-\nber of calibration samples should sufficiently cover their variabil-\nity. Considering the low number of calibration samples it is of\nimportant to cover the variability of the collected spectra and thus,\nthe fields. Following Christy (2008) and Knadel et al. (2011) soil\nsamples were collected from the furrow left by the shank and used\nfor reference analysis. SOC was analyzed using a LECO analyzer\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM.

Spectral preprocessing\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to improve the results of regression modeling, several\nstandard pre-processing methods can be applied to spectral data\nto account for nonlinearities, measurement and sample variation,\nand noise. It is not possible to specify a universal pre-processing\nmethod suitable for all applications. The type of pre-processing\nneeded is data-dependent and needs to be decided upon using a\ntrial and error approach. Both chemical and structural differences\nin the sample can lead to non-linear scatter effects. For lineariza-\ntion of the relationship between absorbance and concentration,\nmeasured reflectance (R) was transformed to log 1/R (Stenberg\nand Viscarra Rossel, 2010). The standard pre-processing techniques\nincluded scatter corrections and derivations (Rinnan and Rinnan,\n2007). Multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) was used to remove\nadditive and multiplicative effects present in the data. Like MSC,\nthe standard normal variate (SNV) transform was applied to\nremove multiplicative interferences of scatter and particle size\neffects from spectral data. Additional detrending calculated a base-\nline function as a least squares fit of a polynomial to the sample\nspectrum. Derivatives were applied to correct for baseline effects\nin spectra for the purpose of removing nonchemical effects and\ncreating robust calibration models. The first derivative of a spec-\ntrum is a measure of the slope of the spectral curve. The slope of\nthe curve is not affected by baseline offsets in the spectrum.\nThus the first derivative is a very effective method for removing\nbaseline offsets. The second derivative is a measure of the change\nin the slope of the curve. In addition to ignoring the offset, it is\nunaffected by any linear ‘‘trend’’ that may exist in the data, and\nis therefore an effective method for removing the baseline offset\nand slope from a spectrum. The 1st and the 2nd Savizky-Golay\nderivatives were applied to the data sets with a second polynomial\norder with 11 smoothing points.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2.5. Calibration model development\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePartial least square regression (PLSR) was applied to generate\ncalibration models between the predictors (sensor data) and the\nsoil properties, separately for each field. It is one of the most\ncommonly used regression methods and produces satisfactory cali-\nbration results for a variety of soil constituents. It models the pre-\ndictors (e.g. sensor data) and the response variable (e.g. soil\nproperty of interest) simultaneously to find the latent variables\n(LV) in the predictors matrix that best predict LVs in the response\nvariable. This regression technique reduces data dimensionality,\nnoise, and is computationally fast. Due to the small number of cali-\nbration soil samples a full cross-validation technique was applied\nhere. Soil structure, moisture, temperature, and particle size can\naffect field spectra (Morgan et al., 2009; Shonk et al., 1991). To\naccount for these different physical factors EC and temperature\ndata were incorporated as predictors in the spectral model devel-\nopment. Models were developed using: vis–NIR (350–2200 nm)\nspectra, EC, temperature and different combinations of the above\nlisted. Due to different ranges and units of the predictors used in\nthe PLS regression, they were modified by autoscaling (mean cen-\ntered and scaled by 1/SD, where SD is standard deviation) prior to\nmodeling. This transformation assured that all variables have the\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003es in Agriculture 114 (2015) 134–144 137\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esame weight in estimating the components.

This was done for each field separately. General\nstatistics of the wet chemistry soil properties for the calibration\nsamples are shown in Table 1. The two investigated fields are rela-\ntively homogenous showing low standard deviations and small\nranges of the listed soil properties. Both have a high sand content\n(mean values of 90%) with a small gradient in SOC (1.4–3.3%)\nand clay (3–6.7%) and consequently low EC values (0.3–3%). As\nreported previously by Stenberg et al. (2010) small range and\nstandard deviation of the soil properties may affect the predictive\nability of the NIRS models. Thus, the addition of other sensor data\n(EC and temperature) is expected to improve the calibration mod-\nels. The improvement is expected especially due to a high correla-\ntion between the soil properties of interest and the EC data\n(Table 2). In Voulund1 the highest reported correlation was\nbetween SOC and EC-sh (0.65) and SOC and temperature (0.60).\nEven higher correlation between SOC and EC was obtained in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe use of densely spaced data points collected in one direction\n(following tramlines in the field) can cause a stripping effect when\nkriging. Therefore, Veris MSP data was averaged in order to create a\nmore grid-like data point distribution. Segments of 6 data points\nwere averaged and the coordinate of the middle point of each seg-\nment was used, resulting in a field grid of approximately\n12 � 12 m. Data sets with predicted soil properties from the two\nfields used in kriging interpolation were divided into training\nand validation data sets comprising 80% and 20% of the total data,\nrespectively, for validating the prediction maps.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3.

General statistics and description of the study sites\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Veris MSP data consisted of measurements acquired at\n7307 and 5138 georeferenced data points collected along 34 and\n25 transects at fields Voulund1 and Voulund2, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2.6. Statistical validation\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe precision of cross-validated calibration models developed\nusing different spectral regions and combinations of auxiliary data\nwere evaluated using statistical estimates: root mean square error\nof full-cross validation (RMSECV), being a measure of the error\nindicating the type of calibration method used; R2 reflecting\nexplained variance by the model; and the ratio of standard error\nof prediction to standard deviation (RPD). An RPD classification\nby Chang and Laird (2002) used for the estimation of model perfor-\nmance classifies RPD values into three groups: RPD \u0026gt; 2 indicating a\nmodel with good predictive ability, 1.4 \u0026lt; RPD \u0026lt; 2 for an inter-\nmediate model yet to be improved and RPD \u0026lt; 1.4 for a model with\nno predictive ability.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best calibration models according to statistical measures\nwere applied to the remaining field spectra to provide point pre-\ndiction of SOC, clay, silt and sand for the two fields.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2.7. Variogram modeling and map generation\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVariogram modeling and interpolation of the predicted soil\nproperties were performed using the ArcGIS version 10.1 software\n(ESRI, Redlands, CA) including the Geostatistical Analyst extension\n(ESRI, 2011).

Also high but negative correlation between sand\nand EC-sh and EC-dp can be seen (0.61 and 0.64, respectively) in\nVoulund2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3.2. Calibration results\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalibration models based on EC data only yielded very similar\nresults for SOC content at the two sites, explaining 65% and 69%\nof the variation with standard errors of 0.43% and 0.34% at\nVoulund1 and Voulund2, respectively (Table 3 and 4). At both\nfields temperature data showed no predictive ability for SOC.\nVis–NIR spectra used in the PLSR models covered a range between\n500 and 2130 nm after noise reduction. Since soil spectra collected\nby the Ocean Optics sensor (500–1073 nm) were in general of a\nlower quality than those collected by the Hamamatsu sensor\n(900–2130 nm), additional PLS models based on the spectral range\nbetween 1073 and 2130 nm were also generated and compared to\nmodels based on the entire vis–NIR range. Only the best result\nfrom the two spectral ranges was reported in Tables 3 and 4.\nExcluding spectral range between 500 and 1073 nm did not\nimprove SOC calibration models at either of the two sites (data\nnot shown). Nor did the pretreatments thus, absorbance spectra\nwere used. The models based on vis–NIR spectra only provided\nbetter results than EC and temperature models at Voulund1\nexplaining 80% of the variation in SOC with a relatively low\nRMSECV of 0.26% (Table 3). A lower predictive ability of vis–NIR\nspectra was reported at Voulund2 site (RMSECV \u003d 0.43 and\nR2 \u003d 0.77) (Table 4).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though temperature on its own showed no predictive\nability for SOC the calibration results in Voulund1 were improved\nsignificantly from RMSECV \u003d 0.26, R2 \u003d 0.80 when using spectra\nonly, to RMSECV \u003d 0.14 and R2 \u003d 0.94 when combined with the\nvis–NIR spectra. In Voulund2 the addition of both EC and tempera-\nture to vis–NIR spectra resulted in the best SOC model with the\nlowest RMSECV (0.17%), high correlation (R2 \u003d 0.93) and RPD of\n3.5, indicating an excellent model. Similarly to modeling at\nVoulund1, the results were improved also significantly after fusing\nthe data as opposed to using single sensor data.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best calibration models for clay when using data from the\nindividual sensors were obtained using soil spectral data at both\nsites. Neither EC nor temperature alone could predict clay content.\nAt Voulund1, reducing vis–NIR spectral range to 1073–2130 nm\nand additional smoothing (Standard Normal Variate correction\nwith de-trending) improved the results for clay prediction produc-\ning a RMSECV of 0.34% and the R2 \u003d 0.76, indicating model with a\ngood predictive ability. At Voulund2, in turn, the reduction of spec-\ntral region did not cause model improvement. The vis–NIR model\n(based on absorbance spectra) resulted in a similar RMSECV\n(0.39%) to that of Voulund1, but a higher correlation between soil\nspectra and clay content (R2 \u003d 0.84).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurther fusion of different sensor data did not increase the pre-\ndictive ability of clay models at Voulund1. At Voulund2 in turn, the\ncombination of vis–NIR spectral data with temperature improved\ncalibration results significantly in comparison to using spectra only\nby decreasing the value of RMSECV to 0.20% and increasing the\nexplained variation to 92%.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe highest predictive ability for silt with individual sensor was\nachieved when using vis–NIR (absorbance) spectra, resulting in\nRMSECV values of 0.35% and 0.31% and R2 values 0.82 and 0.86\nat Voulund1 and Voulund2, respectively. None of the sensor data\ncombinations could outperform the results of spectral models.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly to silt calibration results sand was best predicted\nusing spectral data only. Low errors of predictions (0.85% and\n74%) and high correlations (0.81 and 0.92) were obtained at\nVoulund1 and Voulund2, respectively. The reduction of used spec-\ntral region to 1073–2130 nm gave better results than when using\nthe entire vis–NIR region for sand calibration at Voulund1.

Following this classi-\nfication, the nugget-to-sill ratios in our study showed a moderate\nspatial dependence for all soil properties except for SOC in\nVoulund1 where strong spatial dependence was found.

Yet, despite\na good correlation between sand and EC the addition of EC did\nnot improve the predictive abilities of sand calibration models\nbased on spectral data. Nevertheless, the fact that the calibration\nmodels for SOC and clay based on spectral data were inferior to\nthose based on fused data may be due to moisture effects on soil\nspectra. Organic matter and clay minerals have distinct finger\nprints relating to several functional groups including the hydroxyl\ngroup. The effects of moisture content on soil spectral can be\nobserved across the visible and NIR regions of the electromagnetic\nspectrum (Knadel et al., 2014). In the visible range soil becomes\ndarker with increasing soil moisture content. This is also where\nOM absorption bands can be found. Moreover, water has strong\nabsorption bands in the NIR region with the dominant absorption\nnear 1400 and 1900 nm (Ben-Dor, 2002). Key components in\norganic matter have a peak near 1930 nm. The strong water\nabsorption band near 1900 nm can mask this peak associated with\norganic functional groups. The spectral features of clay minerals\nare due to overtones and combination of the molecular vibration\nmodes of OH functional groups in crystal lattice or absorbed water\n(Ben-Dor, 2002). The major mineral diagnostic regions are located\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\"page\"\u003e\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ed tex\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eronic\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFig. 4.

Due to the fact that absorption bands related to clay\nminerals can be found at the same wavelengths as those of water,\nexcessive moisture content in the soil can mask the signals from\nclay minerals. Additionally, the spectrophotometer used in the\nMSP has a spectral range only extending to 2200 nm, not including\nthe upper part of the NIR range where some of the absorption\nbands related to clay minerals are located. This can explain why\nboth clay and SOC calibration results were improved when soil\nspectra were fused with supplementary data.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA comparison of our calibration results with other studies is not\nstraightforward. Even though the use of mobile sensor platforms\nfor soil properties mapping is increasingly reported in the litera-\nture the included sensor data and the soil properties in focus are\nnot readily comparable. Some studies combined on-the-go mea-\nsurements with laboratory or remotely sensed data for a range of\nsoil properties. Yet, we found no studies using mobile sensing of\nsoils or even on field moist soils targeted for silt and sand predic-\ntion. To ease the comparison we focused mainly on the mobile\nplatform studies including NIR sensors, possibly supported by\nother types of sensors (Table 6).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly the study reported by Knadel et al. (2011) used the Veris\nsensor platform supporting the same sensors (vis–NIR, EC and tem-\nperature). The best predictive ability was reported in their study\nfor a fusion of spectral and EC data. However, much higher\nRMSECV (5.89%) was obtained in their study and was attributed\nto the bimodal distribution and the extremely wide range of SOC\n(Table 6). The application of Veris platform including solely vis–\nNIR or NIR sensors for soil properties mapping was reported in sev-\neral studies. Debaene et al. (2013) tested the potential of on-the-go\nestimation of SOC of mineral soils in Poland using Veris vis–NIR\nsensor. They compared the result from the mobile system to the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eture for the two fields (2 column fitting image).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003es in Agriculture 114 (2015) 134–144 141\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emaps based on soil samples scanned in the laboratory obtaining\nsimilar results from the two approaches. The PLS models, however,\nfor SOC resulted in lower error of prediction (0.19%) and a lower\ncorrelation (R2 \u003d 0.70) probably due generally lower SOC content.\nIn another study two NIR sensors (Veris shank-based and airbone\nhyperspectral vis–NIR sensors) were used and compared for carbon\nmapping (McCarty et al., 2010). Low predictive ability of the val-\nidation results were obtained for the shank-based sensor\n(R2 \u003d 0.53). Christy (2008) used the Veris NIR sensor (920–\n1718 nm) to determine several soil attributes. He obtained accept-\nable prediction of soil OM for eight fields in Kansas with a RDP\nvalue of 1.7 (Table 6). Total carbon was analyzed on a subset of\n20 samples to determine the correlation with OM thus the compar-\nison is not possible. The lower predictive ability of the mobile sys-\ntem in comparison to ours might be explained by a lower spectral\nrange. Shen et al. (2013) used also a Veris mobile NIR sensor to pre-\ndict both SOC and clay in a field in Michigan, USA. Similar to the\nresults from our study better predictions were obtained for SOC\nthan for clay (Table 6). Despite the higher range of SOC in the study\nby Shen et al., 2013, calibration results were comparable to our\nresults when using spectral data in model development (R2 values\nwere not given). However, the performance of their clay calibration\nmodel was significantly lower (RPD \u003d 1.1). The better predictive\nability for clay models in our study may be explained by a much\nlower variation in this property, the higher range of spectropho-\ntometer, and might also be due to different moisture conditions\nat the two of our study sites. Much worse results, however, were\nobtained by Bricklemeyer and Brown (2010) who applied the\nVeris vis–NIR sensor for SOC and clay content mapping in eight\nwheat fields in Montana. The Montana results were consistent\nwith those by Christy (2008) but the mobile spectrophotometer\nwas not able to capture SOC variability. Not even semi-quantitative\nlevels of validation for SOC could be achieved (Table 6).

Knadel et al. / Computers and Electr\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eauthors explained the poor results with the low range and varia-\ntion in SOC, with their range being equivalent to almost half of\nthe variation in SOC in our study. The results from the clay models\nwere improved, however, in comparison to those of SOC (RPD \u003d 1)\nbut still presented no predictive ability. According to the authors\nthis small improvement was caused by a higher variability in clay\n(SD \u003d 9.1).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResults from other NIR platforms than Veris were also reported.\nIn the study by Mouazen et al. (2007) a mobile vis–NIR sensor with\na soil penetration unit was developed and used for different soil\nattributes (total C, pH and P). Lower predictive ability for the online\nvis–NIRS determination of organic C content was obtained\n(RMSEP \u003d 0.48, R2 \u003d 0.74) than in the current study. Their measure-\nments were based on spectral data only (Table 6). Nevertheless,\nwhen comparing their results with our SOC calibration based on\nspectral data only, higher predictive ability of the PLS models in\nthe current study was achieved (RPD \u0026gt; 2). This might be due to\nthe fact that the mobile system of Mouazen et al. (2007) employed\na spectrophotometer covering more limited spectrum (306–\n1711 nm) and thus missing other important regions for SOC deter-\nmination.

Poor predictive ability of the models was\nexplained by low carbon values and the limited range, being the\nlowest of all the compared studies (Table 6). Unfortunately no\ninformation on the SOC variation was provided. Moreover, high\nsand content and differences in moisture content among the two\nfields were suspected to degrade the models.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn summary, differences in calibration performance of the MSPs\ncan be attributed to two main factors: the type of fused instru-\nmentation and the actual differences in soil variability among the\nstudied fields. Higher spectral range of the NIR sensors and the\nadditional fusion with auxiliary data result in higher predictive\nability of the models. Too low contents and limited ranges of the\nselected soil properties in the data sets can lead to degraded results\nof the calibration models, but at the same time too high variability\nmay result in high prediction errors.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5. Conclusions\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mobile sensor platform provided an efficient tool for pre-\ndicting and mapping SOC and soil texture for two fairly homoge-\nnous, sandy, agricultural fields in Denmark. With the use of the\nMSP we were able to obtain densely spaced measurements in the\nfields. Robust calibration models based on sensor data were\ngenerated for all soil properties providing significant labor savings\ncompared to traditional soil texture mapping.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe effect of sensor data fusion was dependent on the soil prop-\nerties studied and their correlation with sensor data. Improved\ncalibration results due to sensor fusion were obtained for SOC\nand clay with a decrease in the mean errors of prediction of almost\n50% in comparison to using single sensor. This might be due to the\nfact that the absorption features of the two soil properties are\nmostly affected by variable moisture content. Thus, by integrating\nthe spectral data with other sensor measurements this NIRS\nmethodological issue may be partly overcome.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, high resolution field maps generated on the basis of\nsensor measurements were able to depict the small spatial vari-\nability of the soil properties present within the two fields. The\nresults of this study show a considerable potential of data fusion\nin field-scale soil characterization for applications such as preci-\nsion agriculture. However, it is important to underline that the\ngeneral predictive ability of mobile sensors depends on soil spatial\nvariability, the concentrations, and the ranges of the soil proper-\nties. Additionally, factors related to the uncontrolled field condi-\ntions can affect the quality of in-situ data resulting in a poor\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM.
