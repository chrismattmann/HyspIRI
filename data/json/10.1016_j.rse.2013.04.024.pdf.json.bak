Despite its importance, our knowledge of the CO2 sources and\nsinks has significant gaps (e.g., Canadell et al., 2010; Stephens et al.,\n2007) and despite efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, atmospheric CO2\ncontinues to increase at a rate of approximately 2 ppm/year (Fig. 1 top\npanel; see also Schneising et al., 2011, and references given therein;\nfor a detailed discussion of Fig. 1 see Section 4).

Atmospheric meth-\nane levels increased until about the year 2000, were rather stable\nduring ~2000–2006, but started to increase again in recent years\n(Dlugokencky et al., 2009; Frankenberg et al., 2011; Rigby et al.,\n2008; Schneising et al., 2011). Unfortunately, it is not well under-\nstood why methane was stable in the years before 2007 (e.g., Simpson\net al., 2012) norwhy it started to increase again at a rate of approximately\n7–8 ppb/year (Schneising et al., 2011).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlobal satellite observations sensitive to near-surface CO2 and CH4\nvariations can contribute to a better understanding of the regional\nsources and sinks of these important greenhouse gases. Information\non GHG surface fluxes (emissions and uptake) can be obtained by\ninverse modeling of surface fluxes (e.g., Bergamaschi et al., 2009;\nChevallier, Bréon, \u0026amp; Rayner, 2007), where satellite observations\nare compared with predictions of a (chemistry) transport model\n(e.g., Fig. 2) and satellite minus model mismatches are minimized\nby modifying the surface fluxes used by the model. This requires\nsatellite retrievals to meet challenging requirements, as small errors\nof the satellite-retrieved atmospheric GHG distributions may result\nin large errors of the inferred GHG surface fluxes (e.g., Chevallier,\nEngelen, \u0026amp; Peylin, 2005; Meirink, Eskes, \u0026amp; Goede, 2006). Instead of\ndirect optimization of surface fluxes it is also possible to optimize\n(other) model parameters used to model the fluxes, as done in Carbon\nCycle Data Assimilation Systems (CCDAS) (e.g., Kaminski, Scholze,\n\u0026amp; Houweling, 2010; Kaminski et al., 2012) or other approaches\n(e.g., Bloom, Palmer, Fraser, Reay, \u0026amp; Frankenberg, 2010).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goal of the GHG-CCI project is to generate the Essential Climate\nVariable (ECV) Greenhouse Gases (GHG) as defined by GCOS (Global\nClimate Observing System): “Distribution of greenhouse gases, such as\nCO2 and CH4, of sufficient quality to estimate regional sources and\nsinks” (GCOS, 2006). In order to get information on regional GHG\nsources and sinks, satellite measurements must be sensitive to near-\nsurface GHG concentration variations.

Most\ncritical are state-dependent systematic errors, which result in\nregional-scale (~1000 km) biases on medium time scales (~ month-\nly), because they will likely bemissed by bias-correction schemes. As\nthe overall impact of the atmospheric concentration error on the sur-\nface flux error depends on the spatio-temporal pattern of the con-\ncentration error, the values listed in Table 1 have to be interpreted\nwith care. The requirements reflect what the GHG-CCI users would\nlike to see achieved. The utility of the data can ultimately only be\ndetermined by careful analysis. The numbers listed in Table 1 serve\nto give a rough indication of the required uncertainties but should\nnot be over-interpreted.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe requirements for XCH4 are also challenging but somewhat\nless demanding than those for XCO2. The main reason is that\nXCH4 is more variable compared to XCO2 relative to its background\nvalue on the spatio-temporal scales relevant for the satellite retrievals\n(e.g., Bergamaschi et al., 2009; Frankenberg, Meirink, van Weele,\nPlatt, \u0026amp; Wagner, 2005; Frankenberg et al., 2011; Meirink et al.,\n2006; Schneising et al., 2011, 2012).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. Retrieval algorithms\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this section, a brief overview of each retrieval algorithm used for\nthe GHG-CCI RR is given. The reader is referred to peer-reviewed publi-\ncations for details. All algorithms used within the GHG-CCI RR are also\ndescribed in the GHG-CCI Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document\n(ATBD) (Reuter, Schneising, et al., 2012).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ECV Core Algorithms (ECAs) generate one or more of the four\nGHG-CCI core data products, XCO2 (in ppm) and XCH4 (in ppb) from\nSCIAMACHY and TANSO (each of the four combinations is a separate\nproduct). An overview of these algorithms is given in Table 2 and briefly\ndescribed in the following sub-sections. Results obtained with all ECAs\nare shown in Fig. 1: the top panel shows northern hemispheric (NH)\ntime series of XCO2 and the bottom panel XCH4 time series. As can be\nseen, the variousXCO2 time series (generatedwith the various algorithms\ndescribed in the following sub-sections) are similar but not exactly iden-\ntical. There are clear differences, e.g., a difference of the seasonal cycle\namplitude, between the two SCIAMACHY algorithms WFMD (Heymann,\nBovensmann, et al., 2012; Schneising et al., 2011) and BESD (Reuter\net al., 2011) likely due to sub-visual cirrus clouds not explicitly considered\nby WFMD. Differences are also due to the different spatial sampling of\nthe various data products. From Fig. 1 it can therefore typically not be\nconcluded which data product is the most accurate. This requires, for ex-\nample, a careful comparison with independent accurate ground-based\nobservations (see Section 5.2). However, one obvious problem can be\nidentified: the SCIAMACHY XCH4 product generated with the IMAP algo-\nrithm (Frankenberg et al., 2011) suffers from a significant high bias\n(relative to several other TANSO/GOSAT XCH4 data products) during\nthe year 2010 (highlighted by the dotted line). This problem is related\nto SCIAMACHY detector degradation issues which are not yet properly\ndealt with by the SCIAMACHY radiometric calibration nor compensated\nby the IMAP algorithm (note that the second SCIAMACHY XCH4 algo-\nrithm WFMD (Schneising et al., 2011) has not yet been applied to 2010\ndata; the WFMD time series covers only the years 2003–2009). As will\nbe discussed in more detail below, the most challenging problems\naddressed within GHG-CCI are related to achieving the required\naccuracy: for XCO2 this is a challenge because of demanding user\nrequirements and for XCH4 the most important challenge was to deal\nwith the progressive SCIAMACHY detector degradation in the spec-\ntral region needed for methane retrieval which started in October\n2005 (see Frankenberg et al., 2011; Schneising et al., 2011, for a\u003c/p\u003e\n\ndetailed discussion).\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4.1. Full Physics (FP) and Proxy (PR) algorithms\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin GHG-CCI, two types of ECAs can be distinguished: The “Full\nPhysics” (FP) algorithms and the light path “Proxy” (PR) algorithms\n(see also Schepers et al., 2012).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFP algorithms model all relevant physical effects such as scattering\nby aerosols and clouds and have corresponding elements as part of\nthe state vector, which contains all parameters which are to be re-\ntrieved. The FP algorithms obtain the dry air column-averagedmole frac-\ntion (needed to compute the dry air column-averaged mole fractions\nof the GHG, i.e., XCO2 and/or XCH4) either from the retrieved surface\npressure or using meteorological information.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe PR algorithms are based on computing the dry air column-\naveraged mole fraction using a “reference gas”, which has to be much\nless variable than the gas of interest on the relevant spatio-temporal\nscales. The PRmethod is used for XCH4 retrieval using CO2 as a reference\ngas. The XCH4 is essentially obtained from computing the ratio of the\nretrieved CH4 column and the retrieved CO2 column. The advantage of\nthis method is that it is potentially very fast, accurate and robust (as\nseveral systematic errors cancel in the CH4/CO2 column ratio). The\ndisadvantage is that a correction is needed for CO2 variability, typically\nbased on a global model (see, e.g., Frankenberg et al., 2005, 2011;\nParker et al., 2011; Schneising et al., 2009, 2011; Schepers et al., 2012).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4.2. SCIAMACHY XCO2 algorithms\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheWeighting FunctionModified (WFM)Differential Optical Absorp-\ntion Spectroscopy (DOAS) algorithm (WFM-DOAS or WFMD) has been\ndeveloped to retrieve vertical columns of several atmospheric gases in-\ncluding the GHGs discussed in this manuscript (Buchwitz, Rozanov, \u0026amp;\nBurrows, 2000). During the last decade, this algorithm has been signifi-\ncantly improved and used to generate global multi-year XCO2 and XCH4\ndata sets from SCIAMACHY (Buchwitz et al., 2005, 2007; Schneising\net al., 2008, 2009). Within GHG-CCI, WFMD has been further improved\nand used to generate long-term consistent time series (Heymann,\nBovensmann, et al., 2012; Heymann, Schneising, et al., 2012; Schneising\net al., 2011, 2012). WFMD has been implemented as a fast look-up\ntable (LUT) based retrieval scheme to avoid time consuming radia-\ntive transfer (RT) simulations. WFMD is a least-squares method\nusing a single constant atmospheric prior (e.g., single constant CO2\nand CH4 mixing ratio profiles, a single aerosol scenario, no clouds).\nWFMD can process one orbit of SCIAMACHY observations in a few\nminutes on a single workstation. Aerosols and cirrus clouds are\nonly treated approximately by considering spectrally broad band\neffects by a low-order polynomial and by post-processing filtering.\nOverall, this results in small but significant biases, especially for XCO2\n(Heymann, Schneising, et al., 2012). Recently, an improved version of\nWFMD has been developed for SCIAMACHY XCO2 retrieval (Heymann,\nBovensmann, et al., 2012, see also Fig. 2) and the XCO2 data set generat-\ned with this latest version has been used for the GHG-CCI RR. For\nSCIAMACHY XCH4 retrieval, the WFMD version described in Schneising\net al., 2011, 2012, has been used (see below).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bremen Optimal Estimation DOAS (BESD) FP algorithm was\nspecifically developed for accurate and precise SCIAMACHY XCO2 re-\ntrieval considering aerosols and clouds thereby overcoming limitations\nof the WFMD algorithm (Reuter et al., 2010, 2011). In contrast to\nWFMD, BESD is not based on a LUT scheme but uses on-line RT model\nsimulations. BESD is therefore computationally muchmore demanding.\nAlso, unlikeWFMD, BESD is based on Optimal Estimation (OE, Rodgers,\n2000) and aerosol and cirrus parameters are state vector elements and\nretrieved in addition to XCO2.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4.3.

Both algorithms are based on adjusting\nparameters of a surface–atmosphere state vector and other parame-\nters to the satellite observations, but differ in many details (different\nRT models, different inversion schemes (OE or Tikhonov-Phillips),\ndifferent schemes for aerosol modeling and inversion, use of differ-\nent pre-processing and post-processing steps, etc.) as discussed in\nCogan et al.

SCIAMACHY XCH4 algorithms\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor SCIAMACHY XCH4 retrievals, PR algorithms are used: WFMD\n(Schneising et al., 2011, see above) and IMAP (Iterative Maximum A\nPosteriori) DOAS (Frankenberg et al., 2011). These algorithms were\nalready well developed when GHG-CCI started but had essentially\nonly been applied to retrieve XCH4 from the first three years of the\nENVISAT mission (e.g., Schneising et al., 2008). Within GHG-CCI, this\ntime series has been significantly extended. The key challenge was\n(and partly still is, see Fig. 1) to deal with the significant detector degra-\ndation in the spectral region needed for methane retrievals after 2005\n(see Frankenberg et al., 2011; Schneising et al., 2011, for details).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4.5.

TANSO has higher spectral resolution than SCIAMACHY which\nis exploited to also retrieve scattering parameters in addition to CH4.\nTwo TANSO XCH4 FP retrieval algorithms are being used within GHG-\nCCI, which are also used for TANSO XCO2 retrieval (see above), OCFP\n(Parker et al., 2011) and SRFP (Butz et al., 2011), in addition to the two\nPR algorithmsOCPR (Parker et al., 2011) and SRPR (Schepers et al., 2012).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5. Round Robin approach and results\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this section an overview of the GHG-CCI Round Robin (RR)\nactivities is given which have been carried out in the first two years of\nthis project.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5.1. Round Robin approach\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ultimate goal of the GHG-CCI RRwas to identifywhich algorithms\nand corresponding data products to use for generating the CRDP. This\ncomprised the further development of existing retrieval algorithms\nwith the goal of meeting the challenging user requirements, the\napplication of these algorithms to generate global multi-year XCO2\nand XCH4 sets, the comparison with ground-based reference data and\ninter-comparisons of the data products generated with the competing\nECAs.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe selection procedure for ECAs and ACAs is described in the\nGHG-CCI Round Robin Evaluation Protocol (RREP, Buchwitz, Reuter,\nChevallier, \u0026amp; Bergamaschi, 2011). Initially the plan was to develop\na score-based selection scheme, i.e., to compute a single number\nfor each algorithm/data product (the higher the number, the better\nthe algorithm), mainly based on satellite — ground-based observa-\ntion differences. However, this was not pursued because a scientifi-\ncally sound basis for the classification could not be established.\nInstead a set of Figures of Merit (FoM), mostly based on differences\nbetween satellite and ground-based observations, have been defined\n(see RREP, Buchwitz, Reuter, et al., 2011) and evaluated. However, as\nexplained in the RREP and also shown in this manuscript, the com-\nparison with the ground-based observations is only one component\nfor the final selection primarily because of the sparseness of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\nground-based network (see Section 5.2). Another major component\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof the selection procedure was the analysis of (global and regional)\nmaps and time series, including comparisons with global state-of-\nthe-art models, and inter-comparisons of the data products generated\nwith the different candidate algorithms. Note that “blind testing” has\nnot been used as it would have been possible to identify the algorithms/\nproducts by using some of their characteristics such as averaging kernels\nand spatial coverage. Some key results of this RR activity are presented\nhere including a summary of the main RR decision results given in\nSection 5.6 for ECAs and Section 6 for ACAs.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the initial ESA specification of the CCI RR exercise it was\nrequired to evaluate “algorithms”. However, complex algorithms such\nas the ones used within GHG-CCI can hardly be evaluated, especially\nnot in terms of identifying “the best one” in terms of smallest biases\nwhen applied to real data. Simulated retrievals have been performed\n(see, e.g., Buchwitz, Reuter, Schneising, et al., 2011; Buchwitz, Reuter,\net al., 2012, and references given therein) but only for the individual al-\ngorithms and not in a consistentmanner. This would have been amajor\nactivity incompatible with the CCI schedule especially if the goal would\nhave been to obtain a better understanding of the differences between\nthe data products obtained from the real observations. In this context\nit has not been identified that any of the algorithms suffer from obvi-\nous shortcomings. All XCO2 algorithms, for example, use different\napproaches to mitigate biases due to scattering by aerosols and\n(thin) clouds, but it is virtually impossible to identify a priori, e.g., based\non a description of the algorithms and the simulation results, which of\nthe approaches will result in the smallest XCO2 or XCH4 biases when\napplied to real data.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat has been evaluated in detail are the endproducts, i.e., the qual-\nity of the XCO2 and XCH4 data products. This means that primarily data\nproducts have been evaluated during RR but not algorithms. As shown\nin this manuscript, this is not a trivial task, e.g., due to the sparseness\nof the TCCON reference data. Therefore, as shown in this manuscript,\nthe RR decisions are not only based on comparisons with TCCON. The\nsatellite retrieval team focused on producing the best possible end prod-\nucts. Which input data to use and how to treat them, e.g., in a dedicated\npre-processing step, has not been prescribed. Pre-processing steps may\nbe critical for the quality of the end product. This is particularly true\nif the instrument shows significant degradation as is the case for\nSCIAMACHY after 2005 especially in the spectral region needed for\nmethane retrieval. To deal with this, quite different approaches have\nbeen used by the two algorithms IMAP (Frankenberg et al., 2011) and\nWFMD (Schneising et al., 2011, 2012). For example, IMAP uses as\ninput data spectra that have been specifically calibrated at SRON and\nIMAP also uses a single so-called “Dead and Bad detector Pixel Mask”\n(DBPM), needed to reject detector pixels which are not useful. In\ncontrast, WFMD uses the official standard SCIAMACHY Level 1 data\nproduct with standard calibration and several DBPMs, each optimized\nfor a certain time period, typically covering one or more years (see\nSchneising et al., 2011, for details).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, it is important to highlight the preliminary nature of the RR.\nThis is due to the fact that all Level 1 input data and retrieval algorithms\nare continuously being improved. An algorithm/data product currently\nidentified to be the best one will not necessarily be the best one in the\nfuture. GHG-CCI therefore needs to be flexible and will aim to consider\nthis in future phases of the CCI.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5.2.

The best independent\nestimates of the TCCON inter-site comparability to date are provided\nby these independent aircraft calibration data. While not exhaustive,\nthese demonstrate consistency at the 0.1% level (1-sigma) for XCO2\n(~0.4 ppm) and 0.2% for XCH4 (~4 ppb), with no obvious inter-\nhemispheric differences (Wunch et al., 2010). Nevertheless, the\nTCCON team recognizes that inter-site comparability needs to be\nbetter characterized, especially for methane (e.g., at Darwin and\nWollongong, not discussed in the references cited above), and work\nis in progress to achieve this. The systematic and random errors of single\nTCCON data are therefore typically 0.4 ppm for XCO2 (1-sigma) and\n4 ppb (1-sigma) for XCH4 (Notholt et al., 2012, based on Wunch et al.,\n2010). Due to these errors of the TCCON data (but also for other reasons,\ne.g., non-perfect spatio-temporal co-location) the estimated systematic\nand random errors of the satellite retrievals as reported here have to\nbe interpreted as upper limit estimates, i.e., the satellite data errors\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunknown.

Inter-comparison method\nDifferent inter-comparison methods have been used, e.g., to ensure\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erobustness of the findings. In addition to the method used and results\nobtained by the validation team (Notholt et al., 2012), which are\nsummarized in this manuscript, independent inter-comparisons of\nthe satellite data products with TCCON have also been carried out\nby the satellite data product provider (Buchwitz, Reuter, et al.,\n2012). The methods differ by various aspects such as investigated\ntime period and direct comparison or comparison after transforma-\ntion to common a priori profiles and application of averaging kernels.\nEach satellite data product provider performed an independent val-\nidation of his data product (considering averaging kernels or not)\ncovering the entire time series (to the extent possible given the lim-\nitations of the TCCON data, see Table 4). In contrast, the validation\nteam has applied the same method to all satellite data products\nand has, for a given product, only used a time period where data\nfrom all competing algorithms were available (SCIAMACHY: XCO2:\n2006–2009; XCH4: 2003–2009, TANSO: mid 2009–2010).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThemethod usedby the validation team is based on a direct compar-\nison of the co-located satellite and TCCON data products. No correction\nfor different a priori profiles and averaging kernels has been applied.\nNote that it is not trivial to consider averaging kernels for the XCO2\nand XCH4 satellite and TCCON retrievals as strictly speaking this re-\nquires a reliable estimate of the real atmospheric variability, which is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ediscussed at Lamont, USA, where the real variability of the CO2 profiles\nis obtained using regular aircraft and other observations. For the global\ndata sets this is not possible. Nevertheless, for someof the satellite prod-\nucts, averaging kernels have been applied by the satellite data provider.\nFor example, Reuter et al. (2013), has applied individual averaging ker-\nnels for all XCO2 products from SCIAMACHY and TANSO by adjusting all\nretrievals to a common a priori using the Simple Empirical CO2 Model\n(SECM) described in Reuter, Buchwitz, et al. (2012). They found that\nthe adjustments are typically a few tenth of a ppm. Reuter, Buchwitz,\net al. (2012), estimated the smoothing errors and found that it is typical-\nly 0.17 ppm for SCIAMACHY XCO2 and 0.05 ppm for TCCON XCO2.\nThese results indicate that the impact of applying or not applying the\naveraging kernels for satellite–TCCON comparisons is small. The reason\nis that the averaging kernels of the TCCON and the satellite data are\nclose to unity and the resulting smoothing error is therefore typically\nquite small, especially for XCO2. For methane the (relative) smoothing\nerrors are somewhat larger, as methane is more variable. For example,\nParker et al. (2011), found that “the mean smoothing error differ-\nence included in the GOSAT to TCCON comparisons can account for\n15.7 to 17.4 ppb for the northerly sites and for 1.1 ppb at the lowest\nlatitude site”. For the SCIAMACHY XCH4 validation results presented\nin Schneising et al. (2012), it has been found that applying averaging\nkernels (by using TM5 model profiles as a common a priori) leads to\nadjustments of 0.4% (approx. 7 ppb). Overall it has been found that\nthe validation results obtained by the validation team (Notholt\net al., 2012) and the satellite data provider (Buchwitz, Reuter, et al.,\n2012), where averaging kernels have been applied for at least some\nof the products, agree well, especially for XCO2 (Buchwitz,\nChevallier, Bergamaschi, \u0026amp; Kaminski, 2012). The comparison of the\nvarious methods used to quantify random and systematic errors of\nthe satellite products (Buchwitz, Chevallier, et al., 2012) indicates\nthat the RR validation results are robust.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the following, the results obtained by the validation team are\npresented. Detailed results will be reported elsewhere (Dils et al.,\n2013). Therefore we here give only a short overview highlighting\nmajor findings.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor each product and each TCCON site a number of Figures of Merit\n(FoMs) have been computed by the validation team. Key results are\nshown in Fig. 3 for XCO2 and Fig. 4 for XCH4., discussed in detail in ded-\nicated sub-sections below. Shown are comparisons of the four GHG-CCI\ncore data products generated with two or more of the candidate algo-\nrithms at the 10 TCCON sites listed in Table 4. The results shown in\nFigs. 3 and 4 have been generated using a spatio-temporal co-location\ncriterion of 2 h and 500 km (for alternative co-location criteria see\nNotholt et al., 2012). Several numerical values are given, which are\nalso listed in Table 5, computed from satellite minus TCCON differences\nfor each single satellite retrieval and the corresponding TCCON mean\nvalue. On the left hand side of Figs. 3 and 4 the mean satellite–TCCON\ndifferences are shown for each of the 10 TCCON sites and all four core\ndata products and their corresponding ECAs. For each ECA the standard\ndeviation of the station-to-station bias has been computed (“StdDev”)\nand the total number of co-located satellite retrievals used for compar-\nison (“N”). The standard deviation of the station-to-station bias is\ninterpreted as a relevant measure of the systematic error (“relative\naccuracy” or “relative bias”). The standard deviation is more relevant\nto characterize systematic errors compared to, for example, the\nmean difference. Most critical is to achieve high “relative accuracy”\n(or low “relative bias”) not necessarily high “absolute accuracy”\n(although this would of course be better). For example, a constant\noffset of the satellite data would not be critical if the data are being\nused for surface flux inversemodeling (see Section 3) and this is con-\nsidered by computing the standard deviation. On the right hand side\nof Figs. 3 and 4 the standard deviations of the satellite–TCCON differ-\nences are shown for each TCCON site. They are a measure of the\nrandom error (scatter) of the satellite retrievals.

Satellite XCO2 comparisons with TCCON\nThe comparison of the two SCIAMACHY XCO2 retrieval algorithms\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWFMD and BESD with TCCON shows the following (Fig. 3, top half):\nBESD has typically lower systematic errors (0.7 ppm) compared to\nWFMD (1.3 ppm) and also a higher precision (2.3 ppm compared to\n5.1 ppm). Ultimately it can be expected that the biases of BESD will be\neven lower as it has been identified (not shown) that the BESD RR\ndata set suffers from problems related to the SCIAMACHY Level 1 data\nproduct used (version 7 consolidation level u, “L1v7u”). This data prod-\nuct was used because it was the latest version available when the final\nRR data set had to be generated and because it also covers the time pe-\nriod after 2009. The previous Level 1 version 6 (L1v6), used by WFMD,\ndoes not suffer from these problems but is only available until the end\nof 2009, where theWFMDdata set ends. It has been found that BESD re-\ntrievals for selected months using the improved new version L1v7w\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFig. 3.

It is there-\nfore necessary and planned to reprocess the entire SCIAMACHY data set\nwith BESD using L1v7w, e.g., for the generation of the CRDP. A potential-\nly important pro for WFMD for certain applications is the much larger\nnumber of data points.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe comparison of the two TANSO XCO2 retrieval algorithms OCFP\nand SRFP with TCCON shows the following (Fig. 3, bottom half): The\nbiases depend on site and are typically in the range +/−1 ppm. They\nare very similar for both algorithms. This is also true for the standard\ndeviation of the difference between the TANSO and TCCON esti-\nmates, which is typically in the range 2–3 ppm. The number of co-\nlocations is also nearly identical for both algorithms but varies signif-\nicantly from site to site, which is true for all comparisons shown in\nFigs. 3 and 4.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs shown in Table 5, the precision requirement for XCO2 ismet by all\nalgorithms.

Satellite XCH4 comparisons with TCCON\nThe comparison of the two SCIAMACHY XCH4 retrieval algorithms\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWFMD and IMAP with TCCON shows the following (Fig. 4, top half):\nOverall, the systematic differences with respect to TCCON vary from\nsite to site from nearly 0 ppb at Lamont to 20–30 ppb at the southern\nhemisphere (SH) sites Darwin, Wollongong, and Lauder, but are very\nsimilar for WFMD and IMAP. The reason for the large differences at\nthese SH sites has not yet been identified. This is probably not due to\nthe TCCON reference data as these differences are larger than the esti-\nmated TCCON inter-site comparability (see Section 5.2.1) and also the\ncomparison with TANSO XCH4 (see below) does not show this type of\nsystematic deviation (the OCFP results however also show a low bias\nat the SH sites compared to the northern sites esp. at Darwin). Agree-\nment is within +/−10 ppb if these SH sites are excluded. In order to\nobtain an estimate of the relative biases (i.e., considering that an overall\noffset is not critical), the standard deviation of the station-to-station\nbiases has been computed: it amounts to 11 ppb for WFMD and\n15 ppb for IMAP. The standard deviation of the satellite–TCCON dif-\nferences, which is a measure of the single measurement precision\n(1-sigma), is on average 82 ppb for WFMD and 50 ppb for IMAP. Be-\ncause nearly all TCCON sites started operation after 2005 (see\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFig. 4. As Fig. 3 but for the GHG\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTable 4), i.e., after the loss of important SCIAMACHY methane detector\npixels due to detector degradation, the values listed for SCIAMACHY in\nFig. 4 are not representative for the years 2003–2005. Until the end of\n2005 the performance was much better and the corresponding values\nare listed in curved brackets in Table 5. A possible explanation for the\nlarger scatter (worse precision) of WFMD after 2005 is that WFMD is\nan unconstrained least-squares algorithm whereas IMAP is based on\nOptimal Estimation and uses detailed CH4 information (as a function\nof latitude, altitude and time but not longitude) from a global model\nas a priori information. This raises the question why the precision of\nthe two data products is similar for 2003–2005. This could be related\nto the fact that only a single DBPM is used by IMAP whereas WFMD\nhas used a DBPM optimized for 2003–2005. Another possible explana-\ntion could be the use of differently calibrated input data. As shown in\nFig. 4, the number of satellite soundings used varies significantly from\nsite to site, but overall is very similar for WFMD (N \u003d 37,628) and\nIMAP (39,489) (at least at TCCON sites, for other locations this may\nnot be true, see Figs. 9 and 10).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe comparison of the four TANSO XCH4 retrieval algorithms\n(OCPR, OCFP, SRPR, SRFP) with TCCON shows the following (Fig. 4,\nbottom half): The biases depend on the TCCON site but are in the\nrange +/−15 ppb. The estimated relative bias is best for OCPR\n(2 ppb) and worst for OCFP (8 ppb). OCPR has the largest number\nof data points (followed by SRPR). The number of data points is\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-CCI XCH4 data products.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\"page\"\u003e\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ere d\nthan\nchn\nrieva\nr, et\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eerva\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e353M.

The FP algorithm with the lowest rela-\ntive bias is SRFP (3 ppb). The PR algorithm with the lowest relative\nbias is OCPR (2 ppb). The standard deviations of the satellite–TCCON\ndifferences are nearly identical for all four algorithms.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs shown in Table 5, the SCIAMACHY XCH4 product for 2003–2005\nmeets the threshold precision requirement (but not for 2006 and later\nyears due to the detector degradation). In contrast, the TANSO XCH4\nhas a much higher precision and even the breakthrough precision re-\nquirement is met by all algorithms. All TANSO XCH4 algorithms meet\nthe relative accuracy (relative bias) user requirement — some are\nclose to or even better than the goal requirement. For SCIAMACHY this\nis only true for 2003–2005.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConcerning the final RR algorithm selection decision, it is important\nnot to over-interpret the numerical values listed in Table 5 due to the\nsparseness of the TCCON sites. For this and other reasons, the TCCON\ncomparisons presented and discussed in this section are only one key\ncomponent of the GHG-CCI RR activities.

Inter-comparison of XCO2 data products\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin GHG-CCI two algorithms have been further developed to\nretrieve XCO2 from SCIAMACHY, namely WFMD and BESD, and two\nalgorithms to retrieve XCO2 from TANSO, namely OCFP and SRFP. In\naddition, there are three non-European TANSO algorithms presented\nand discussed in the peer-reviewed literature whose data products\nhave also been used for comparison: (i) the official operational TANSO\nalgorithm (v02.xx) developed at the National Institute for Environmen-\ntal Studies (NIES) in Japan (Yoshida et al., 2011; in the following\nreferred to as “NIES” algorithm), (ii) a scientific algorithm called\nPPDF (Pathlength Probability Density Function) also developed at\nNIES (Bril, Oshchepkov, Yokota, \u0026amp; Inoue, 2007; Oshchepkov, Bril,\nMaksyutov, \u0026amp; Yokota, 2011; Oshchepkov, Bril, \u0026amp; Yokota, 2008, 2009,\n2012; Oshchepkov et al., 2012), and (iii) NASA/JPL\u0027s ACOS (Atmospheric\nCO2 Observations from Space) v2.9 algorithm (Crisp et al., 2012; O\u0027Dell\net al., 2012).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe global XCO2 data products fromall 7 algorithmshave been inter-\ncompared within GHG-CCI (Buchwitz, Chevallier, et al., 2012; Reuter\net al., 2013). The analysis revealed the following: The various satellite\nXCO2 data products all capture the expected large scale variations of\natmospheric CO2 such as the time dependent north–south gradient\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Figs. 5 and 6, discussed below) and the CO2 increase and seasonal\ncycle (Fig. 1) but exhibit differences in the spatio-temporal pattern\nwhich – depending on region and time – may exceed the relative bias\nuser requirement of 0.5 ppm.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypical examples are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. Fig. 5 shows compar-\nisons of the four GHG-CCI XCO2 algorithms (BESD, WFMD, SRFP, OCFP).\nFig. 6 shows the GHG-CCI algorithms as well as the three non-European\nalgorithms mentioned above (ACOS (v2.9), PPDF (NIES PPDF-D), and\nNIES (v02.xx)) for the two months September 2009 and May 2010. Also\nshown is the ensemble data product generated with the EnseMble\nMedian Algorithm (EMMA) algorithm, discussed below, TCCON XCO2,\nand XCO2 from NOAA\u0027s CO2 assimilation system CarbonTracker (CT)\n(Peters et al., 2007). As can be seen, all satellite retrieval algorithms\ncapture the north–south XCO2 gradient, which is significantly different\nfor the two months shown, in good to reasonable agreement with\nTCCON and CarbonTracker (Fig. 6). As can also be seen, differences\nbetween the data products often exceed 0.5 ppm, particularly at\nlocations remote from TCCON sites (e.g., Sahara, South America,\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eata products retrieved with ECAs obtained from comparisons with ground-based TCCON\ne retrievals during 2003–2005, i.e., before significant detector degradation of themethane\neising et al.

As discussed in Section 5.2, it appears virtually impossible\nto use TCCON to determine which algorithm performs best, at least\nfor TANSO. For SCIAMACHY it has been shown that BESD outper-\nforms WFMD in terms of single measurement precision and bias\nnot however in terms of number of observations, which is signifi-\ncantly higher for WFMD. It is also likely that a “best data product”\nfor all conditions does not exist at present as each retrieval algorithm\nis expected to have its strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, which\nalgorithm performs best may depend on the spatio-temporal interval\nof interest. Clearly, more research is needed to understand the differ-\nences between the various XCO2 data sets shown in Figs. 5 and 6. One\napproach to further assess the relative quality of the various satellite-\nderived global XCO2 data sets is to compare them with their median.\nThis approach is presented in the following section.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5.3.1. Comparison with ensemble median (EMMA)\nIn this section we aim at answering two related questions: (i) How\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto determinewhich data product is likely “the best”, if the largest dif-\nferences are at locations remote from validation sites (ii) Which\ndata product should be used for inverse modeling of surface fluxes\nif all products differ and if it is not clear which product would give\nthe most reliable results To answer these questions we use the me-\ndian of the various XCO2 products. The situation appears to be similar\nto that for climate modeling: it is not clear which “model” is the best\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\"page\"\u003e\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e354 M.

This is the underlying idea of the EnseMble Median Algorithm\n(EMMA, Reuter et al., 2013). As described in more detail below and in\nReuter et al. (2013), EMMA computes the median of an ensemble of\nindividual XCO2 data products, which can be used for comparison with\nthe individual data products, e.g., to identify outliers. However, the\nEMMA XCO2 product has also been generated to be useful as a stand-\nalone XCO2 data product for inverse modeling and other applications.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFig. 5.Maps of monthly mean XCO2 at 10° × 10° resolution as obtained using different GHG-C\nSCIAMACHY and TANSO merged using EMMA for September 2009 (left) and May 2012 (right)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strength of using an ensemble of satellite data products was\nhighlighted at the end of the first year of the GHG-CCI project\n(Buchwitz, Reuter, Schneising, et al., 2011), when biases (0.5%) between\nBialystok TCCON XCO2 and co-incident satellite data were identified in\nthe majority of algorithms participating in the GHG-CCI. This bias oc-\ncurred due to an empirical correction of known magnitude, to account\nfor a laser-sampling bias in the FTS data before September 21, 2009,\ninadvertently being applied in the wrong direction. A bias in XCH4 in\nthe early part of the Bialystok time series that occurred due to missing\nfits in one of the CH4 micro-windows was also brought to light by com-\nparisons to the ensemble of satellite retrievals.

(2013).\nTherefore here only a short overview is given. The presented version of\nEMMA (v1.3a) uses the 7 individual satellite XCO2 products shown in\nFigs. 6 and 7 and generates a Level 2 product (i.e., a product containing\nthe XCO2 of the individual satellite soundings including uncertainty\nestimate and other information such as averaging kernels) using the\nmedian in each 10° × 10° monthly grid cell (“voxel”). In short, EMMA\nworks as follows: For each voxel, the mean XCO2 value is computed\nfor each of the 7 individual data products. The median of the 7 mean\nvalues determineswhich of the individual satellite Level 2 data products\nis used for the EMMAdata product for that voxel (if a certain voxel is not\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFig. 6.

Using themedian has several advantages compared to, for exam-\nple, using themean value. A key aspect is that themedian is robust with\nrespect to outliers. Using themedian essentially removes outliers. This is\nof critical importance as each of the individual data products appears to\nsuffer from outliers but where they appear and when is not known a\npriori and depends on the algorithm. Of at least equal importance is\nthat the GHG-CCI users need a Level 2 data product (individual sound-\nings) and not a Level 3 data product (e.g., gridded monthly averages).\nFurthermore, the use of an ensemble of data products possibly permits\nthe generation of more reliable uncertainty estimates, obtained from a\ncombination of the ensemble scatter and the reported uncertainties of\nthe individual algorithms (which are primarily estimates of the random\nuncertainty). This would in particular be important to get a handle\non the systematic error component of the uncertainty, which is very\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(bottom (b)) generated using several individual satellite retrieval algorithms: BESD and\nt has been generated from the ensemble of the individual SCIAMACHY and TANSO XCO2\nnTracker (CT, v2011).

Thefigure has been obtained using\nthe EMMA Level 3 data product (10° × 10°, monthly \u003d 1 voxel). For each voxel the mean XCO2 value for each algorithm has been computed and the median using all algorithms. The\n“Agreement with the Median” (left) has been computed as follows: For algorithm i the number of voxels which agree with the median within 0.2 ppm have been counted (\u003dNi).\n100% corresponds to the sum of these numbers (N \u003d Σi Ni). The percentages shown are Ni / N ∗ 100%. The percentages of “Potential Outliers” (right) have been calculated using the\nsame method except that all voxels have been counted where the differences to the median are larger than 2 ppm. As can be seen from the left figure, the data product which agrees\nbest with themedian is the ACOS product (v2.9, 21% agreement) followed by the similar OCFP algorithm (19% agreement). The largest number of potential outliers have the data products\ngenerated with the two very fast algorithms WFMD (32%) and PPDF (16%).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e356 M.

For example, the EMMA product,\nbut also most of the individual TANSO products and SCIAMACHY/\nBESD, agree well or at least reasonably with each other as well as with\nTCCON and CarbonTracker (see green and yellow smileys), whereas\nthis is not always true for the two very fast algorithms WFMD and\nPPDF (see red smileys). Fig. 7 shows pie charts indicating the overall\nagreement and disagreement of each of the individual algorithms with\nthe median. The results are consistent with the already reported find-\nings, e.g., better performance of BESD compared to WFMD and similar\nperformance of the TANSO XCO2 algorithms.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large number of other comparisons of the individual data products\nand the EMMA product with TCCON but also with CarbonTracker have\nbeen carried out.

Both data sets agree reasonablywell (with-\nin typically +/−10 ppb) over most parts of the SH land areas but over\nsome areas WFMD XCH4 can be up to approximately 20 ppb higher.\nOver the NH the situation appears to be more complex. Both data sets\nshow elevated methane over large parts of China, south-east Asia and\nIndia, but the patterns are not identical, with WFMD being higher over\nsouth-east Asia and lower over parts of India compared to IMAP.\nWFMD and IMAP not only use differently calibrated input data (stan-\ndard versus non-standard calibration) and different retrieval methods\n(least squares versus OE), but also different post-processing quality fil-\ntering schemes. The latter is reflected by differences in spatial coverage\n(e.g., WFMD methane is not restricted to land observations only) and\nnumber of retrievals over a given region (see right hand side panels of\nFig. 9). The data density differs significantly depending on region.

Significant differences\ncan be expected as the regional differences exceed the bias threshold\nrequirement of less than 10 ppb. The discussion also shows that de-\npending on region the differences can be significantly larger than the\nestimated biases listed in Table 5, which are based on the analysis of\nthe satellite data at TCCON sites only.

A direct comparison of the two data\nproducts at TCCON sites is also shown in Fig. 11 indicating agreement\nwithin typically 10 ppb (1-sigma). Nevertheless, inspection of global\nmaps also reveals significant differences, depending on region and\ntime. Qualitatively, this is similar to the results found for the\nSCIAMACHY data sets discussed in the previous section, but the differ-\nences shown in Fig. 11 for TANSO are significantly smaller compared\nto the differences for SCIAMACHY shown in Figs. 9 and 10. Fig. 11\nshows a global OCPR-SRPR methane difference map for July 2009. As\ncan be seen, the differences may exceed 5 ppb (breakthrough require-\nment) or even 10 ppb (threshold requirement) over certain extended\nregions such as India. Comparisons between the two FP TANSO XCH4\ndata products OCFP and SRFP have also been carried out. Using SRFP,\ntwo years of global TANSO data have been retrieved but the comparison\nhad to be limited to TCCON sites only because of limitations of the OCFP\ndata set which is not yet available globally. It has been found that\nthe inter-station bias is smaller for SRFP (~4 ppb) compared to OCFP\n(~8 ppb) and that the scatter of the SRFP data is somewhat smaller\ncompared to the OCFP (14 ppb versus 16 ppb). These findings are\nconsistent with the results presented in Table 5 but have been derived\nindependently (see Buchwitz, Reuter, et al., 2012). It has also been\nfound that the agreement between the two PR algorithms is significant-\nly better than the agreement between the two FP algorithms. This may\nbe due to the fact that PR algorithms are simpler but may also indicate\nthat at the current stage of development the PR algorithms are more\nmature (note that they also deliver much more data points, see\nSection 5.2).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5.6. Algorithm selection results\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main goal of the RR exercise was to determine which satellite\nretrieval algorithms to use to generate the CRDP. Based on the results\npresented and discussed in the previous sections, algorithms have\nbeen selected. The selection results are presented in the following\nsub-sections.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5.6.1. Selection results: SCIAMACHY and GOSAT XCO2\nWithin GHG-CCI, two SCIAMACHY and two TANSO XCO2 algorithms\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave been further developed and the corresponding data products have\nbeen inter-compared. They have also been compared with three other\nTANSO XCO2 data products generated outside of this project: with the\ntwo TANSO XCO2 products generated at NIES, Japan, (i.e., the operation-\nal TANSO product (Yoshida et al., 2011) and the scientific PPDF product\n(Oshchepkov et al., 2011)) and with the NASA ACOS team product\n(Crisp et al., 2012; O\u0027Dell et al., 2012). Analysis of all seven products\nindicates that the precision requirement has been met, but not the\nvery demanding bias requirement of less than 0.5 ppm (approximately\n1 ppm has been achieved at TCCON sites). Clearly, more work on the\nindividual retrieval algorithms is required to achieve this goal and it\nhas been decided to continue with all algorithms. A possible exception\nis the fast SCIAMACHY XCO2 WFMD algorithm, which shows a reduced\ndata quality in terms of precision and biases compared to the computa-\ntionally much more demanding BESD algorithm. On the other hand\nthe WFMD product has significantly (3–4 times) more data points\ncompared to BESD and therefore much better coverage compared to\nany of the other data products including BESD. GHG-CCI aims at taking\nadvantage of the fact that an ensemble of state-of-the-art data products\nexists which can be exploited. To this end, the EnseMble Median Algo-\nrithm (EMMA) has been developed (Reuter et al., 2013). EMMA gener-\nates a Level 2 XCO2 product using the median of the individual data\nproducts thereby largely eliminating outliers of the data products gen-\nerated with the individual algorithms. EMMA may also improve the\nerror characterization using the ensemble scatter. Preliminary analysis\nindicates that EMMA outperforms each of the individual algorithms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\nEMMA also permits the identification of potential weaknesses of the\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eindividual algorithms, which can be used to improve the individual al-\ngorithms. Taking this into account, it has been decided to proceed\nwith all satellite XCO2 algorithms and to add the EMMA data product\nto the GHG-CCI product portfolio.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5.6.2. Selection results: SCIAMACHY XCH4\nData products generated with two algorithms have been assessed:\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWFMD (Schneising et al., 2011, 2012) and IMAP (Frankenberg et al.,\n2011). Comparison with ground-based TCCON observations revealed\nthat both data products are very similar with respect to biases. This is\nalso true for the estimated single measurement precisions for the time\nperiod 2003–2005, when the SCIAMACHY detector did not yet suffer\nfrom major degradation in the spectral region needed for methane\nretrieval.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter 2005, the WFMD methane shows a larger scatter (~80 ppb)\ncompared to IMAP (~50 ppb). Both data products have to be used\nwith care for the time after 2005 due to potential bias issues related to\ndetector degradation as indicated by the TCCONcomparison at southern\nhemisphere TCCON sites, where both data products show a low bias of\n20–30 ppb depending on FTS site. Considering only this analysis, one\nwould conclude that both data products are essentially equivalent and\none may therefore select one of them. Analysis of spatially resolved\nglobal methane distributions as generated by the two algorithms how-\never shows significant differences, depending on region and time,\nwhich are larger than the requiredmaximumbias of 10 ppb, i.e., are sig-\nnificant for regional-scale methane surface flux inversions. Due to the\nlack of appropriate reference data such as TCCON, it was not yet possible\nto determine which of the two data products is the most accurate.\nTherefore, it has been decided to proceed with both algorithms and to\ncontribute with both alternative data products to the CRDP pointing\nout the strength and weaknesses of the two approaches. Users will be\nencouraged to use both data sets, to determine to what extent their\nfindings depend on the data product used, and to report these findings\nto the GHG-CCI retrieval experts.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5.6.3. Selection results: TANSO XCH4\nFour algorithms and their corresponding data products have been\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eevaluated: OCFP and OCPR (Parker et al., 2011) and SRFP and SRPR\n(Butz et al., 2011). All data products showvery similar biases and scatter\nwhen compared with ground-based TCCON observations. The number\nof data points is however significantly higher for the “Proxy” (PR) algo-\nrithms compared to the “Full Physics” (FP) algorithms and the agree-\nment between the two PR data products is better than for the FP\nproducts, indicating a higher level of maturity of the (simpler) PR algo-\nrithms. Note that the SCIAMACHY XCH4 algorithms, WFMD and IMAP,\nare also PR algorithms and that the FP algorithms are relatively new\nand currently in their early stages of development. Overall, the OCPR\nalgorithm shows a slightly better performance compared to SRPR\n(primarily in terms of number of data points at TCCON sites). It has\ntherefore been decided to continue with OCPR within GHG-CCI. The\nPR XCH4 algorithms depend on a CO2 correction using model data. The\nlong-term goal of GHG-CCI is to use a FP algorithm that is independent\nof a CO2 model. Because the SRFP algorithm shows a somewhat better\nperformance compared to the OCFP algorithm (e.g., lower station-to-\nstation biases at TCCON sites), it has been decided to continue with\nthe SRFP algorithm, despite the lower number of data points compared\nto OCFP. In summary, four TANSOXCH4 algorithms have been evaluated\nas part of theGHG-CCI RR and two of these algorithms have been select-\ned for further use within GHG-CCI: OCPR and SRFP.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6.

In addition, retrieval algorithms for a number of\nother satellite instruments such as IASI andMIPAS have also been further\ndeveloped, but not in competition.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubstantial progress has been made during the first two years\n(September 2010–August 2012) of the GHG-CCI project. For exam-\nple, longer XCO2 and XCH4 time series have been generated from\nSCIAMACHY with improved data quality and better error characteri-\nzation (Frankenberg et al., 2011; Heymann, Bovensmann, et al., 2012;\nHeymann, Schneising, et al., 2012; Reuter et al., 2011; Schneising et al.,\n2011, 2012). The same is true for TANSO (Butz et al., 2011; Cogan et al.,\n2012; Parker et al., 2011; Schepers et al., 2012).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral retrieval algorithms have been further developed in\ncompetition during the GHG-CCI RR and used to generate global multi-\nyear data sets of XCO2 and XCH4 from SCIAMACHY and TANSO. The\ndata products have been evaluated by comparison with ground-based\nTCCON observations, by inter-comparisons of the data products generat-\ned with the different candidate algorithms, and by comparisons with\nother data sets including global models. Due to the sparseness of\nthe TCCON network it was not planned to base the algorithm selection\ndecision only on satellite–TCCON comparisons. It has been found that\nnearly all candidate algorithms produce data with very similar quality\nat TCCON sites, i.e., show similar satellite–TCCON differences. Significant\ndifferences have however been found remote from TCCON when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\"page\"\u003e\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e361M.

It has been identified thatmore research\nis needed in order to understand the differences between the various\ndata sets. It was therefore not possible for all products to clearly identify\nwhich of the candidate algorithmsperforms best. The goal of the RRwas\nto identify which of the competing algorithms to use for the CRDP.\nThe selected algorithms are listed in Table 6. A summary of the RR\nalgorithm selection decision and justification is given in Section 5.6\nfor the GHG-CCI ECV core data products and in Section 6 for additional\nproducts generated with algorithms not in competition during the\nRR phase.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe climate and inverse modeling community requires long-term\ndatasets of near-surface-sensitive CO2 and CH4 observations that are\nas accurate and precise as possible. The goal of GHG-CCI is to build up\nsuch a time series starting with SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT (March 2002–\nApril 2012) and being continued with GOSAT (launch 2009) and future\nGHG satellite missions such as OCO-2 (Boesch, Baker, Connor, Crisp,\n\u0026amp; Miller, 2011), Sentinel-5-Precursor (Butz et al., 2012) and potentially\nCarbonSat (Bovensmann et al., 2010). As shown in this manuscript,\nsignificant progress has been made to achieve this goal, but more work\nis needed in order to meet the demanding user requirements for as\nmany conditions as possible.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcknowledgments\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis work was primarily funded by ESA/ESRIN (GHG-CCI) but also\nreceived funding from EU FP7 (grant agreement No. 283576, MACC-\nII), DLR (SADOS), and the State and the University of Bremen.
