Our hypothesis\nwas that the PDS-standardized field spectra can be used to predict soil carbon effectively with calibrations derived\nfrom existing spectroscopic databases of spectra recorded in the laboratory on dried, ground and sieved samples.\nIn our experiments we used field spectra recorded in situ with a portable spectrometer at 124 sites in 11 paddy\nfields in Zhejiang Province, China.We sampled the soil at these same sites, recorded their spectra in the laboratory\nand measured their soil organic carbon (SOC) contents with a conventional laboratory technique. Two-thirds of\nthe samples were used to relate the laboratory spectra to SOC by partial least squares regression (PLSR), and the\nremaining one-third was used as an independent validation dataset. We selected a representative set of samples\nfrom corresponding field and laboratory spectra that we could use as the PDS transfer set. Piecewise direct\nstandardization was used to relate each wavelength in the laboratory spectra to the corresponding wavelength\nand its neighbours in the field spectra. The field spectra of the validation samples were then corrected with\nPDS so that they acquired the characteristics of the spectra measured under laboratory conditions. The approach\nwas evaluated by (i) quantifying the similarity between the PDS-standardized spectra and their corresponding\nlaboratory spectra, (ii) measuring the accuracy of their SOC predictions on the independent validation dataset\nand (iii) comparing these results with those of direct standardization (DS). Both PDS and DS led to considerable\nimprovements in the predictions of SOC (R2 \u003d 0.71, R2 \u003d 0.60, respectively), compared with those with original\nfield spectra (R2 \u003d 0.03). However, fewer transfer samples were needed with PDS to obtain similar results.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntroduction\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the largest store of terrestrial organic carbon, soil has a profound\neffect on the global carbon cycle. Small changes in soil organic\ncarbon (SOC)might lead to large fluctuations in atmospheric green-\nhouse gas concentrations (Lal, 2004). Accurate determination of\nthe concentration and spatial variation in SOC is also important for\nprecision agriculture, assessment of soil erosion and degradation,\nand understanding biogeochemical cycles. To obtain information\nabout SOC, it is necessary to use methods of measurement that\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorrespondence: Z. Shi.

To\nexploit these databases fully, it is necessary to develop methods\nthat can remove such environmental effects from proximally sensed\nfield spectra.\nIn a previous study (Ji et al., 2015), we investigated use of the\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edirect standardization (DS) algorithm (Wang et al., 1991) to remove\nthe effects of environmental factors on proximally sensed spectra.\nDirect standardization effectively accounted for the effects of soil\nwater and improved predictions of SOM with proximally sensed\nspectra using a calibration model derived from the Chinese soil\nspectral database. In Ji et al. (2015) we showed that the DS approach\nremoved those effects more effectively than external parameter\northogonalization (EPO) (Roger et al., 2003; Minasny et al., 2011)\nand spiking (Guerrero et al., 2010).\nPiecewise direct standardization (PDS) (Wang et al., 1991) is\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esimilar to DS in that PDS relates the absorbance of selected standard\nspectra recorded in the laboratory to their field spectra with the\nsame model structure. However, in PDS the standardization is\naccomplished by using neighbouring wavelengths that are within\na selected window size instead of an entire spectrum as in DS.\nTherefore, PDS will not only enable correction of differences in\nintensity but also wavelength shifts and peak broadening (Feudale\net al., 2002). Previous studies have used PDS successfully for the\nstandardization of vis–NIR spectra as well as electrochemical and\nnuclear magnetic resonance data (Bouveresse \u0026amp; Massart, 1996;\nHerrero \u0026amp; Ortiz, 1997; Alam et al., 2009).\nHere, we investigated the use of PDS to correct for the effects\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof water and other environmental factors from proximally sensed\nspectra to improve the prediction of SOC content. Our hypothesis\nwas that PDS would outperform DS because the nonlinearities\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebetween field and laboratory spectra are modelled better by several\nlocal multivariate models than by a single global multivariate\nmodel as used in DS. Our aims were to: (i) describe PDS and\nits use to correct for the differences between spectra recorded\nunder field conditions and in the laboratory, (ii) determine whether\nspectroscopic calibrations developed with laboratory spectra can be\nused to predict SOC using PDS-standardized field spectra and (iii)\ncompare PDS and DS.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaterials and methods\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProximal vis–NIR sensing, soil sampling and laboratory\nmeasurements\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA total of 124 sensing sites were selected at random from within\n11 paddy fields (Table 1) around the China National Rice Research\nInstitute in Zhejiang province, China. This is amajor rice-producing\nregion with more than 2000 years of history of continuous cul-\ntivation (Wissing et al., 2011). The sites ranged in latitude from\n29∘03′N to 30∘10′N and in longitude from 119∘10′E to 122∘48′E.\nThe fields ranged in size from 0.25 to 1 ha and had been under rice\ncultivation for more than 10 years. The characterization of the 11\npaddy fields is described in Table 1. We recorded the soil spectra by\nproximal in situ and stationary vis–NIR sensing, and at the same\nsites we also collected soil samples. These samples were transported\nto our laboratory for further measurements. The paddy fields were\ndrained and the soil was allowed to dry for 10 days before sensing\nand sampling.\nAt each sensing site, the water content of the surface soil\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(0–20 cm) was measured twice by a FieldScout TDR 300 soil\nmoisture meter (Spectrum Technologies Inc., Aurora, IL, USA)\nwith a 20-cm guide, after which the measurements were averaged\nand recorded. A cubic soil sampler (10 cm× 10 cm× 20 cm) was\nused to take the soil sample. Then, 10 spectra were recorded at\neach of three randomly selected locations on one vertical side of the\nsample within the A-horizon. The average of the 30 spectra would\nrepresent the spectrum for the site. Before measurement, the soil\nsample was flattened, its surface made even and areas with stones,\nroots or voids were avoided.

The 124 soil samples were air-dried, ground\nand sieved to a size fraction of less than 2mm. The vis–NIR spectra\nof these samples were recorded again under laboratory conditions.\nHereafter, we refer to these spectra as laboratory spectra, or XL.\nIn the laboratory, we also measured the SOC content of the 124\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esamples by dry combustion at 1100∘C with a multi N/C® 3100\n(Analytik Jena AG, Jena, Germany).\nFor the spectroscopic measurements we used a Fieldspec Pro\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFR vis–NIR spectrometer and its high intensity contact probe\n(PANalytical, B.V, Boulder, Colorado, USA, formerly Analytical\nSpectral Devices) for both field and laboratory measurements.

The selection was done with the Kennard-Stone\n(K-S) algorithm (Kennard \u0026amp; Stone, 1969). Partial least squares\nregression was used to predict SOC with a model derived from the\nlaboratory spectra of the 82 samples.

The\npartial least squares regression (PLSR) algorithm (Wold et al.,\n2001) was used to formulate the regression models. The PDS\ntransfer matrix was formed by recording the set of regression\ncoefficients obtained from the PLSR models derived from within\nthe moving window along a spectrum from beginning to end.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3 The field spectra from the validation dataset were then stan-\ndardized using the PDS parameters so that they were directly\ncomparable to those measured in the laboratory, which removed\nthe environmental effects.

However, the accuracy of\npredictions of the two methods was comparable when 50 or more\nsamples were used.

Figure 6 shows\nthe predicted values of SOC plotted against the observed values. To\nhelp with interpretation, we back-transformed the log10 predictions\nto the original scale.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiscussion\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArtefacts occur in the transfer spectra if the transfer parameters are\nnot well determined (de Noord, 1994). The main causes of artefacts\nare the size of the local wavelength region, the number of transfer\nsamples and the number of PLSR factors used in the local regres-\nsions. By comparing the similarity between the PDS-standardized\nfield spectra and laboratory spectra, we determined that, for our\nexperiment, a 31-nmwindow size was adequate. Asmany soil mate-\nrials have diagnostic absorption features that are 20–40 nm wide at\nhalf the band depth (Hunt, 1977), the field spectra within a window\nsize of 31 nm have stronger correlations with laboratory spectra than\nthose within the entire wavelength region. The results of the present\nstudy indicated that the first PLSR factor only should be used in\nthe local regressions in PDS transfer. This is because of collinearity\nof the spectra in the small wavelength domain with fewer transfer\nsamples.\nAs for the DS algorithm, a subset of samples that represented\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe entire experimental dataset well was needed to measure the\ndifference in the response of spectra measured under field and\nlaboratory conditions. Too few or too many samples in the transfer\nset can lead to under- or over-fitting, which reduces the performance\nof the standardization. Here, we determined the optimal number\nof transfer samples by using both the spectral similarities and the\nensuing prediction accuracies of SOC. The optimal number of\ntransfer samples used for the PDS algorithm was 20, whereas 50\ntransfer samples were needed for the DS algorithm. Better transfer\nperformance was achieved by PDS with fewer transfer samples\nbecause the local rank of each window in PDS was smaller than the\nrank of the total data matrix used in DS. Air-drying, grinding and\nmeasuring only 16% (20 out of 124) of the samples in the laboratory\nwill take less time than for the whole set.

Ji et al.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etransfer samples to the whole dataset will depend on the variation\nin the soil and environment in the study region.\nIn this study, the local PDS regressions derived in small windows\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eenabled better and more detailed standardization of the laboratory\nand field spectra than DS, and PDS was good at correcting the more\nsubtle differences between them.More accurate predictions of SOC\nwere obtained with PDS than with DS when a smaller number of\ntransfer samples were used. However, for PDS we needed to take\nthe first derivatives of the spectra, whereas this was not necessary\nfor DS. The use of PDS with the original spectra produced artefacts\nin the wavelength regions that are commonly attributed to water.\nIn a previous study (Ji et al., 2015) we reported that DS performed\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebetter than EPO and spiking for removing the effects of water\nand environmental factors from proximally sensed spectra. Table 4\nsummarizes the comparison between PDS, DS, EPO and spiking\nfor removing the effects of water and environmental factors from\nproximally sensed (field) spectra. Readers are directed to Ji et al.\n(2015) for details on DS, EPO and spiking.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConclusions\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe concluded that both PDS and DS can remove the effects of\nwater and other environmental factors from proximally sensed field\nspectra. The standardized field spectra can be used to predict SOC\neffectively from spectroscopic calibrations formulated with labora-\ntory spectra. Fewer transfer samples were needed to implement PDS\nadequately than to implement DS. In this study, the ratio of transfer\nsamples to the whole dataset was 16% for PDS and between 40 and\n50% for DS. Compared with DS, which broadly removes the effects\nof water and environmental factors on field spectra, PDS works\nmore locally. Therefore, it can be used to remove these effects, but\nit can also account for the more subtle differences between labo-\nratory and field spectra. Adequate spectral pre-treatment might be\nrequired before the use of PDS, whereas it is not necessary for DS.\nOur results indicate the potential of in situ proximal vis–NIR\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esensing to estimate rapidly the soil organic carbon content of\nlocal soil with calibrations developed with large laboratory-derived\nspectroscopic databases.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcknowledgements\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur work was supported by the Research Fund of the State Key\nLaboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Nanjing Institute\nof Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Science (Y412201430),\nNational Natural Science Foundation of China (No.41271234) and\nZhejiang University Project 985 for the PhD scholarship of Wenjun\nJi.

We\ntested different numbers of transfer spectra, and we describe how\nwe did this next. The transfer matrix, B, of size p× p of unknown\nparameters accounts for the variation in both XL and XF, and E is\nthe residual matrix. A detailed description of the calculation of E is\ngiven in Wang et al. (1995) and Ji et al. (2015).\nTo calculate the transfer matrix B, first we removed the additive\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enoise denoted by E (Equation (1)), by mean centring the laboratory\nspectra XL and field spectra XF of the transfer samples. Therefore,\nEquation (A1) may be rewritten as:\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXL \u003d XFB, (A2)\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFigure A1 Structure of the diagonal transfer matrix B for the piecewise\ndirect standardization (PDS) algorithm showing the transfer coefficients.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhere XL and XF represent the mean-centred spectra of XL and XF,\nrespectively.\nAs an improvement over the DS algorithm, PDS relates the\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003espectral response of the transfer samples recorded at wavelength\ni in the laboratory (denoted by XLi) to the wavelengths in a window\naround i (denoted by XFi) recorded in the field (Wang et al., 1991).\nThe wavelength windows are made up of a set of spectral responses\nrecorded at each wavelength (denoted by xFi), and symmetrical\naround every wavelength in this study as follows:\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXFi \u003d\n[\nxF(i−j), xF(i−j+1), ......, xF(i−1), xFi, xF(i+1), ......xF(i+j−1), xF(i+j)\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e]\n.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(A3)\nThe laboratory spectra at wavelength i were then regressed on\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto the field spectra with data from within the selected window as\nfollows:\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003exLi \u003d XFibi, (A4)\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhere xLi is a vector of the spectral value at wavelength i with a\nsize of t× 1, XFi has a size of t×ws, where ws is the window size,\nws\u003d 2j+ 1 and bi is a vector with the transfer coefficient for the ith\nwavelength with a size of ws× 1.\nPartial least squares regression was used to calculate the transfer\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecoefficient bi. During movement of the ith wavelength from the\nbeginning to the end of the entire wavelength range, a set of the\ntransfer coefficients was obtained for each wavelength. The transfer\nmatrix was formed diagonally as follows:\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eB \u003d diag\n(\nbT1 ,b\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eT\n2 , … ,b\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eT\ni , … ,b\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eT\nm\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e)\n, (A5)\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhere m is the number of the wavelengths used in the PDS\nalgorithm and the other elements are zero. The transfer coefficients\nand the diagonal transfer matrix are shown in Figure A1.\nStandardization of the field spectra was done with the validation\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eset and the same model structure as in Equation (A1):\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eX′F42 \u003d XF42B + E.
